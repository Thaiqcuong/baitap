					<p>What has the answerthe beautiful concert I have ever taken part in with many people and the miracle of sound of piano beautiful concert I have ever taken part in with many people and the miracle of sound. As you know, my pianist is Yiruma and in last concert I couldn’t believe that he appeared in my eyes and gave me a big hug after his performance. I also listen a soothing music which is played by him and other professional musicians. Only when I heard his song from the stage I feel anythings around me seem to disappear and I can fly with many stars on the sky to forget all my fears which I suffered before.</p>
